## Getting Started

If you're new to programming or Python, we recommend starting with the exercises and gradually moving on to open-source projects and templates. Here's how you can get started:

1. **Explore the Python Exercises**: Check out our collection of Python exercises designed to help you build your coding skills step by step. Navigate to the [Python Exercises](./python-exercises) directory to get started.

2. **Contribute to Open Source Projects**: If you're looking for real-world experience, explore our beginner-friendly open-source projects. These projects are a great way to learn about collaborative coding and contribute to the developer community. Visit the [Open Source Projects](./open-source-projects) directory to find opportunities to get involved.

3. **Use Project Templates**: Save time on setting up new projects by using our project templates. We offer a variety of templates to kickstart your development efforts. Find them in the [Project Templates](./project-templates) directory.

## Python Exercises

In the [Python Exercises](./python-exercises) directory, you'll find a collection of programming exercises and challenges covering various Python topics. Whether you're a beginner or looking to sharpen your skills, these exercises are designed to provide hands-on experience and reinforce your learning.

## Open Source Projects

Our [Open Source Projects](./open-source-projects) are open for contributions from beginners and experienced developers alike. These projects cover a wide range of topics and technologies, allowing you to work on real-world code and collaborate with other developers.

## Project Templates

Our [Project Templates](./project-templates) are designed to help you jumpstart your own coding projects. These templates provide a basic project structure, so you can focus on building your application without worrying about setting up the initial boilerplate code.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community to improve our exercises, projects, and templates. If you'd like to contribute, please follow our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed instructions on how to get started.
